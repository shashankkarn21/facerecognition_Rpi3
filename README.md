# facerecognition_Rpi3
here are the codes to be used to recognise face using   raspberry pi 3 and opencv 3.3.0 and python3.5
Its realy amazing when you can do recognition stuff with such a small device yet accurately 
I have included two folders each containing codes and environment for recognizing face 
The first one contains code for recognizing using a regular USB webcam where one can use webcam for creating dataset 
the second one contains code for recognizing using webcam as well as PiCam where one can use PiCam for creating dataset
both the folders contain code for recognizing face using both webcam and PiCam
